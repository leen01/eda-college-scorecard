For private institutions, it includes all full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates who receive Title IV aid. The total cost of attendance depends on whether full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates live on campus, off campus (not with family), or off campus (with family). For academic-year institutions, net price represents an average of all programs and includes only full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates who first enrolled in the fall term. For non-academic-year institutions (program or continuous enrollment), net price represents the program with the largest enrollment at the institution and it includes full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates who first enrolled at any time during the academic year.
